            The old UI design is unwelcoming.
          </h2>
          <p>
            It does not have a consistent design language across components and
            pages, demonstrated by conflicting color usages and themes. The
            excessive use of carousels in the design creates a lot of
            inconvenience for the user when browsing courses.

            Core features are nonfunctional.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many core functionalities of the old system are not working such as
            parsing and extracting user data from resumes, searching for courses
            based on keywords, managing user's skills, and most importantly
            recommending courses based on user's skills.

            The system architecture is unnecessarily complicated.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The old system uses expensive and respectively complex solutions
            like AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, and two separate databases (Neo4j and
            MongoDB) for storing user data even though in-house on-premise
            solutions are available.

            Database is inefficiently used.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The old system used Neo4j as the main database but only for storing
            user data. It opts for a neural collaborative-filtering model that
            requires hand-labeling for 3000+ skills. Consequently, it fails to
            leverage the nature of Neo4j being a graph database, which is
            well-known for recommendation system applications.
